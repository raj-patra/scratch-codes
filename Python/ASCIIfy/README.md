## ASCIIfy Image
This python script converts the input image to an ASCII version of itself. This is achieved by giving a different range of grayscale values to different special characters from the ASCII set. The whole image is then converted based on this.

### Usage
```
cd Python/ASCIIify
pip install -r requirements.txt

py asciify.py [file_name]

# Example - Image to ASCII
py asciify.py oof.jpg
```
