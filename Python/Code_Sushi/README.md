## Code Sushi
Inspired from the falling code snippets from the `Matrix` series.

Running the script renders a GUI window and prints random string characters till your memory gets eaten up from the huge string produced.

Boot it up and pretend you are a hacker ;)

### Usage
```
cd Python/Code Sushi
pip install -r requirements.txt

py sushi.py
```
